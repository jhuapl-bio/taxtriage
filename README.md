## About

TaxTriage is a flexible, containerized bioinformatics pipeline designed to identify pathogens within complex samples/specimens (e.g., respiratory swabs, lesion swabs, whole blood) using untargeted DNA or RNA sequencing data. It is designed for short- (Illumina) or long-read (ONT, PacBio) platforms, and incorporates numerous software packages to perform quality control, organism classification, and read mapping. Additionally, TaxTriage incorporates intermediate data into a unified confidence metric for all organisms identified. The final analysis output is incorporated into an Organism Discovery Report, represented as a single PDF, with summaries of the intermediate data supporting pathogen identification. TaxTriage is designed for broad deployment and early-stage outbreak investigations and is not intended for use as a standalone diagnostic capability.

### Description

The TaxTriage pipeline aims to democratize metagenomic sequence analysis for early warning and outbreak investigations, both in public health and potentially clinical settings. To enable this capability, TaxTriage was developed to ingest short- or long-read metagenomic sequencing data generated from tissues (human or animal). The intent is to provide non-bioinformaticians a tool capable of generating species-level identifications of pathogens from raw metagenomic or targeted sequencing data. Specific modules are developed to consider sequencing chemistry and sample types (e.g. blood vs. saliva, etc.). Strain, variant, or clade-level distinction may be possible with specialized datasets, but it is anticipated that the level of granularity would require subsequent, specialized analyses.

- Quality control steps
- In-silico host depletion
- Classification of reads
- Mapping of reads to reference genomes found to be "top hits"
- Confidence metric generation (e.g., depth/breadth of coverage, %nt ID)
- Threshold mechanisms
- De-novo assembly
- Detailed MultiQC reports
- Concise final report (intended to have all data fields required for use in clinical settings)

For the purpose of giving an initial triage of taxonomic classifications, using Kraken2 database(s), that can then be ingested into a CLIA-style report format. This component is under active development, but in the current state it is capable of running a set number of samples end-to-end using a user-created samplesheet in `.csv` format. The output formats include PDF and `HTML` which are highly interactive and distributable.

See [Important output locations](https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage/blob/main/docs/usage.md#important-output-locations) for information on where to get the most important output files from the pipeline.

See [here](https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage/blob/main/docs/usage.md#top-hits-calculation) for information on how "top hits" is located

#### Alerts

:warning: If you make changes to the code within a nextflow-pulled repo, a change can result in a conflict in updating already cloned repos when running the test profile or called `-latest -r main/stable`. As a result you must run `nextflow drop https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage` first. This only applies to pipelines run by calling the remote repo and the previously mentioned parameters. If you expect to make local changes frequently, you should just `git clone` and `git pull` manually and run the pipeline from the `main.nf` file. See [here](https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage?tab=readme-ov-file#running-on-local-nf-files-test-config) for more info

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/taxtriage/results).

Tax Triage is designed as a pipeline for the purpose of giving an initial triage of taxonomic classifications, using Kraken2 database(s), that can then be ingested into a CLIA-style report format. It is under active development, but in the current state it is capable of running a set number of samples end-to-end using a user-created samplesheet in `.csv` format. The output format is a `HTML` which is highly interactive and distributable.

Efforts are underway to provide full support of this pipeline on [nf-core](nf-core.re) to provide a seamless deployment methodology. The pipeline also requires installation of [Docker](https://docker.com) or [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/) (_CE ONLY_ v4+) for the individual modules within it. Because these modules are separate from the source code of TaxTriage, we recommend following the examples outlined in the [usage details](docs/usage.md) first to automatically run the pipeline and install all dependencies while also giving you some example outputs and a better feel for how the pipeline operates.

[See Here for full usage details](docs/usage.md)

[See Here for troubleshooting & FAQ](docs/troubleshooting.md)

## Installation

TaxTriage requires 2 primary installs for it to work

1. Nextflow
2. Singularity or Docker (recommended)

### 1. Nextflow

Follow instructions [here](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) or run these commands in your WSL2, Native Linux, or Mac environment

```
# Make sure that Java v11+ is installed:
java -version

# Install Nextflow
curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash

```

Note, this command requires sudo to move to your home path. If you are on an HPC, make sure that nextflow is in your $PATH if not globally available
Place it in your `$PATH`

```
# Add Nextflow binary to your user's PATH:
mv nextflow ~/bin/
```

If installing globally, requiring sudo, type:

```
sudo mv nextflow /usr/local/bin
```

When complete, verify installation with `nextflow -v` to see the version

### 2. Containerization Approach Install

Choose _A_ (Recommended - Docker) or _B_. If on a HPC, talk with your IT to get B. Singularity setup. You do NOT need to install both software tools.

#### A. Docker

Follow these steps for your OS [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) - IF on WSL2 (Windows), choose Docker Desktop for Windows and it should be available automatically in your WSL environment

#### B. Singularity

[Install Instructions](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html)

## Quick Start

Make sure you have either Docker or Singularity installed, as well as Nextflow

### Test Run

This will pull the test data and run the pipeline. It should take ~10-15 minutes.

```
nextflow run https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage -r main -latest -profile test,docker -resume
```

‚ùóIf you want singularity instead, make sure to specify that in the profile instead of docker like: `test,singularity`

### Cloud

Follow the steps [here](docs/usage.md#aws-with-nextflow-tower)

### Offline Local Mode

In some cases, you may not want to always pull the latest update(s) each time your run the pipeline. To solve this issue, you have 2 primary options:

#### A. Reference remote url, don't specify latest

```
nextflow run https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage -r main -profile test,docker -resume
```

Here, we remove the `-latest` which will not attempt to pull updates. This will only work if you've already run the pipeline (thus pulling the code locally) in online mode like in the initial example for a test run

#### B. Clone the repo first, reference local main file

Here, we instead clone the repo. Then, we reference the launchfile called `main.nf` that is locally on our system. We need to ensure that we're always in the repo's directory each time we do this too

First we clone

```
git clone https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage.git
```

Then we `cd` into our directory

```
cd taxtriage
```

Finally, we run a test run (feel free to edit inputs based on your own data needs after the first test run)

```
nextflow run ./main.nf -profile test,docker -resume
```

Please be aware that intermittent portions of the pipeline will still use internet by default. You can instead run other commands like the example [here](https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage/blob/main/README.md#running-it-without-internet-availability) to remedy this problem.

### Local Data

:warning: If you get an error on uncommitted changes please run the `nextflow drop -f https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage`

```
nextflow drop -f https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage
```

Then run the pipeline normally as described in previous steps

### Running it with the local config (for laptops/workstations) with limited RAM and a different (auto-downloadable) db

```
nextflow run https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage  \
  --outdir tmp_viral \
  -resume \
  --input examples/Samplesheet.csv \
  -r main -latest \
  --db "viral" --download-db \
  -profile local,docker
```

### Running it by overriding some parameters from the local config

```
nextflow run https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage \
   --input examples/Samplesheet.csv -r main -latest \
   --db viral --download_db \
   --outdir output_viral --max_memory 10GB --max_cpus 3   \
   -profile docker  -resume --remove_taxids "9606"
```

:warning: Please see the contents of test or local config to figure out what the defaults are for those profiles

Remember, if you are doing a single taxid, wrap it with '' inside the "" quote

#### Using a db that is on your local filesystem

Make sure you use a local k2 database in your system. Assuming (for this example) you've pulled and decompressed a k2 database like k2_viral [See here for more](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2) and change it with the `--db` parameter like below.

```

nextflow run https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage \
   --input examples/Samplesheet.csv \
   --db "./k2_viral" -r main -latest \
   --outdir output_viral_local  \
   --profile local,docker \
   -resume
```

Note that the `--db` parameter is changed to a local path which contains the k2d files for kraken2 to operate.

### Running it without internet availability

This will use a local assembly text and reference fasta, assuming the reference FASTA is called `refer.fasta`

You will need 3 files locally on your system

1. assembly
2. reference_fasta
3. db

```

nextflow run https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage \
   --input examples/Samplesheet.csv \
   --db "k2_viral" -r main -latest --skip_kraken2 \
   --outdir tmp --reference_fasta ./refer.fasta \
   -profile local,docker \
   -resume \
   --demux \
   --assembly examples/assembly_summary_refseq.txt

```

Be aware that this skips the metagenomics portion of the pipeline and **only** does alignment using the local reference fasta.

#### Running on local nf files (test config)

:warning: Make sure you're in the `jhuaplbio/taxtriage` repo first!

```
nextflow run ./main.nf -profile test,docker
```

See [here](https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage/blob/main/docs/usage.md#nf-coretaxtriage-usage) for a full list of input parameters and options available based on your own needs

If you would like more information on the confidence metrics, view it [here](https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage/blob/main/docs/usage.md#confidence-scoring)

If you want to download the databases from scratch, you can see them here
Make sure to Download these databases to your `Desktop` or wherever you are the most comfortable. Remember the location and specify the `--db` parameter as the absolute path. For example `~/Desktop/flukraken2`. Also, remove the `--download-db` parameter

- [standard-8](https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/kraken/k2_standard_08gb_20230605.tar.gz)
- [viral](https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/kraken/k2_viral_20230605.tar.gz)

## Pipeline summary

<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Quick Start Highlight

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.10.3`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) (you can follow [this tutorial](https://singularity-tutorial.github.io/01-installation/)).

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

   ```console
   nextflow run https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage -profile test,docker --outdir ./outdir
   ```

   Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

   > - The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker` or `singularity` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
   > - Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
   > - If you are using `singularity`, please use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enables you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

   <!-- TODO nf-core: Update the example "typical command" below used to run the pipeline -->

   ```console
           nextflow run https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/taxtriage -r main -latest --outdir test_output -profile <local,docker/singularity>
   ```

## Modules

0. Subsample (OPTIONAL)
1. Guppyplex (Oxford Nanopore Only)
2. QC Plotting part 1 (pycoQC ‚Äì Oxford Nanopore)
3. Trimming (Trimgalore ‚Äì Illumina, Porechop ‚Äì Oxford Nanopore)
4. Filtering ( Kraken2 ‚Äì Illlumina, Oxford Nanopore)
5. QC Plotting part 2 (FastQC ‚Äì Illlumina, Nanoplot ‚Äì Oxford Nanopore)
6. Classification ( Kraken2 ‚Äì Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, Krona Plots)
7. Alignment for Stats ( BWAMEM2 ‚Äì Illumina, Minimap2 ‚Äì Oxford Nanopore)

- :warning:Currently, the only realignment is going to be based on a taxid call. For example, if there will not be a complete realignment of "order" despite there being multiple species all within that order. For the most part, this is limited to more specific ranks like species, strain, subspecies etc.

8. Report Generation ( MultiQC ‚Äì Illumina, Oxford Nanopore)
